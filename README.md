### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

As I put it for the sake of brevity;

These repositories are things I'm either practicing or testing. I don't focus so much on whole projects as much as I do refining or testing various methods and design patterns.

_Using a Language Model as a tool to better define my intentions:_

> ~~These repositories serve as containers for my experimental endeavors, specifically focused on the methodical practice and verification of individual programming concepts.~~ Rather than pursuing the creation of complete, self-contained software projects, I dedicate my efforts to the meticulous refinement and empirical testing of discrete coding methodologies and architectural frameworks for organizing software components.

Personally, I wouldn't think to phrase it that way, as in the context of my life it usually doesn't serve me well to speak with such layered jargon. Then again, as the write this, my mood is casual, which tends to prefer easier language. However, the easier language can and will give a certain impression. 

Anyway...as a DevOps minded person, it's a challenge to contexualize a personal set of repostories that aren't polished projects.
