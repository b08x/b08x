_Using a Language Model to help define intentions and reflect experience:_

> Rather than pursuing the creation of complete, self-contained software projects, I dedicate my efforts to the meticulous refinement and empirical testing of discrete coding methodologies and architectural frameworks for organizing software components.

Personally, I wouldn't think to phrase it that way, as in the context of my life it usually doesn't serve me well to speak with such layered jargon. Doing so creates lofty expectations that require time and energy to satisfy. And as the write this, my mood is casual, which tends to prefer easier language. However, the easier language can and will give a certain impression. So, another trick to authentic Generative AI use, is then to transparently consider the original thought along with the language model interpretation, which is dense and wordy, and often hard to follow. 

Having said all that, I feel most authentic when I say these repositories are used to store tools I personally use for learning or for tasks related to a specific job.
