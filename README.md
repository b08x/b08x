### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

A tinkerer at heart, I love experimenting and learning through code! I enjoy exploring different approaches to problem-solving, debugging complex issues, and building focused utility tools inspired by the Unix philosophy. 

Ruby is my love, Bash is my reliable friend, and Python... well, we have a working relationship.

Expect to find a variety of experimental projects and utility scripts in my repositories. And if you do look through, you might find some gems, you might find some happy accidents!
