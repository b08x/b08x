### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

As I'd like put it for the sake of brevity;

These repositories are things I'm either practicing or testing. I don't focus so much on whole projects as much as I do refining or testing programming methods and design patterns.

_Using a Language Model as a tool to better define intentions and reflect experience:_

> ~~These repositories serve as containers for my experimental endeavors, specifically focused on the methodical practice and verification of individual programming concepts.~~ Rather than pursuing the creation of complete, self-contained software projects, I dedicate my efforts to the meticulous refinement and empirical testing of discrete coding methodologies and architectural frameworks for organizing software components.

Personally, I wouldn't think to phrase it that way though, as in the context of my life it usually doesn't serve me well to speak with such layered jargon. And as the write this, my mood is casual, which tends to prefer easier language. However, the easier language can and will give a certain impression. So, another trick to authentic Generative AI use, is then to transparently consider the original thought along with the language model interpretation, which is dense and wordy, and often hard to follow. Having said that, I feel most authentic when I say these repositories are used to store tools I personally use for learning or for tasks related to a specific job.
